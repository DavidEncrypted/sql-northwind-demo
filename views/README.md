# Database Views

This directory contains views for the Northwind database.

Views are stored queries that can be treated as virtual tables. They are used to simplify complex queries, implement row-level security, and present data in a more business-friendly format.

## Future Improvements

Potential views to add:
- CustomerOrders - Combines customer and order information
- ProductInventory - Shows current stock levels with reorder status
- EmployeeSales - Summarizes sales by employee
- OrderDetails - Detailed order information with product names
- SupplierProducts - Products by supplier with inventory levels
- SalesReport - Monthly/yearly sales summaries
- ShippingStatus - Order shipping status with tracking
