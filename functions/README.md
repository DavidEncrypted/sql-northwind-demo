# Database Functions

This directory contains SQL functions for the Northwind database.

Functions are routines that encapsulate business logic and return a single value based on the input parameters. They can be used in SELECT statements and other SQL expressions.

## Future Improvements

Potential functions to add:
- Calculate order totals
- Validate product inventory levels
- Format customer/employee full names
- Calculate shipping costs
- Age order/invoice calculations
